### Summary

In Cuckoo, players are dealt one card from a shuffled deck. On a player's turn, they can either keep their card or try to swap it with their clockwise neighbor. If the neighbor has a King, the swap is denied, otherwise it must be accepted. The last player can swap with a random card from the deck, but must keep their card if the random card is a King. The player with the lowest card at the end of the game loses the game.
