### Summary

In Go Fish, players are dealt 5 cards from a shuffled deck. Anytime a player has 4 cards with the same rank, they discard those cards from their hand and record them as a match. On a player's turn, they can ask any other player to give them cards that match the rank of one of the cards in the asking player's hand. If the asked player has cards of that rank, they are passed to the asking player. If not, the asking player draws the top card from the deck. When a player makes a match, they get another turn, otherwise it is the next player's turn. The game continues until one player has zero cards, or the end of the deck is reached. The player with the most matches wins the game.
