### Summary

A game of Hearts for four players consists of thirteen tricks. First, shuffle a standard deck of cards. Each player receives thirteen cards. For each trick, players play one card to the trick. The first player will set the lead suit for the trick, which subsequent players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they may play any card from their hand. Also, the first player is restricted to not play a card from the Hearts suit unless one has already been played. Once all cards have been played, the player who played the highest card that matches the suit of the led card will collect all the cards in the trick and become the first player for the next trick. Once all tricks have been played, players earn one point for each ♡ collected in tricks, plus 13 points if they collected the Q♠. If a player happens to collect all ♡ and the Q♠, then they will Shoot the Moon and instead subtract 26 points from their score. The player with the lowest point value wins the game.
