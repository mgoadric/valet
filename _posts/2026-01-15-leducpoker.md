### Summary

Leduc Hold'em uses a deck with only 6 cards. The deck is shuffled, and one card is dealt face-down to each player. Two rounds are played. On their turn, each player has the choice to fold, call, or raise the bid. If a player folds, the other player wins. Players can raise once per round. If both players call in the first round, the top card in the face-down deck is flipped up, and a second round of bidding begins, with the same choices for each player. If neither player folds in the second round, players reveal their cards, and the player that can make the highest hand wins their bet.
