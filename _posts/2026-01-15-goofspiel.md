### Summary

Goofspiel (also known as GOPS) is a simultaneous bidding card game. Each player is dealt one suit for their hand, keeping the Diamonds suit separate and shuffled. Each round, a Diamond card is turned face-up, followed by each player simultaneously privately selecting a card from their hand. Once all have chosen, the selected cards are turned face-up, and the player who played the highest rank is awarded the Diamond card. After 13 rounds, the player with the highest award cards total wins the game.

### Rules of Play

### Variants Used

When players tie in their bids, the prize card is carried over to the next round. A tie in the last round means those cards are not awarded.
