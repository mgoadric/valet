### Summary

To play Rummy, shuffle a French deck and deal 10 cards to each player. Turn the top card of the remaining deck face-up to start the discard pile. Play alternates between players until one player holds no cards. On their turn, players draw the top card from the face-down deck or the face-up discard pile. If the player has at least three cards in a run of one suit in sequence, or a set of equal ranked cards, they make create a meld a play these cards face-up in between the players. Cards can then be added to existing melds on the table. Finally, the player discards a card from their hand. The player with the least points in their hand when the game ends wins.

### Rules of Play

### Variants Used

We use the Block Rummy variant, and add the ending condition of an empty deck. This prevents random players, commonly used in Game AI, from getting stuck in a loop.
