### Summary

Klaverjassen is a trick-taking partnership card game. Cards are assigned point values depending on their rank. The Piquet deck is shuffled and 8 cards are dealt to each player. Play proceeds in rounds, with complex rules for how and when to follow suit and play trump. The winner of each trick leads the next trick. Points are awarded for individual cards, differentiated by trump and non-trump suits. Points are also calcuated based on if a trick contains sets of face cards, runs in sequence in the same suit, or marriages (King and Queen pairs).  The team that captures cards with the most points wins.

### Rules of Play

These rules are summarized from [{{ page.source }}]({{ page.source }}).

### Variants Used

Valet uses the Utrecht rule for determining trump, where the first player picks the trump suit after seeing their hand.

It also incorporates the Amsterdam rules for playing trumps (quoted from Pagat):

> 1. If you cannot follow suit and the card which is winning the trick so far has been played by the opposing team then you must beat this card with a trump if you can. If they are winning with a trump, you must play a higher trump if you can. If you have no higher trump you must throw away a card of another (non-trump) suit. You are not allowed to undertrump (play a lower trump) unless your hand consists entirely of lower trumps;
> 2. If you cannot follow suit and the card which is winning the trick so far is your partner's, then you may play any card of any suit, except that if your partner's winning card is a trump, you are not allowed to undertrump unless your hand consists entirely of lower trumps;
> 3. If trumps are led then subsequent players must beat the highest trump so far played to the trick if they can, even if this highest trump was played by their partner. If they cannot beat the highest trump so far played, they must play a lower trump. If they have no trumps at all, they can play any card.
