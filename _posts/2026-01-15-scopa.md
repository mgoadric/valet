### Summary

Scopa is a game for two players using the Italian deck of 40 cards. The deck is shuffled, and four cards are dealth to the middle of the table to form the Pool. Play occurs in multiple rounds, where each player is first dealt 3 cards. Players then take turns playing one card. If the card matches a card or cards in the pool, the player collects the matching cards and the played card. Additionally, if the pool is empty after collecting cards, the player scores a point. Otherwise, the played card is added to the central pool. At the end of the game, players score a point for having most cards, having the most coin cards, having the seven of coins, and having the highest set of high cards per suit. The player with the most points wins.
