### Summary

In Golf, the deck is shuffled, and then 6 cards are dealt face-down to each player in a 3x2 grid. One card is turned face-up to begin the discard pile. On a player's turn, they can either draw the top card from the discard pile, or the top of the remaining deck. The player can then decide to replace one of their cards, either face-down or face-up, with the drawn card, keeping the new card face-up. Play continues until one player has all face-up cards in their grid. Duplicate card ranks in columns are removed, and then players score for their remaining cards. The player with the lowest score wins.
