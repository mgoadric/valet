### Summary

In Schwimmen, a Piquet deck is shuffled and each player is dealt three cards. Three additional cards are placed face down in the middle of the table. The dealer decides if they want to exchange their hand for the three face-down cards. Then, these table cards are turned face-up, and play begins. On a player's turn, they can exchange their whole hand with the face-up cards, or exchange an individual card, or pass. If all players have passed, and cards remain in the deck, then three new cards are dealt face-up to the table and play resumes, otherwise the game ends. After making their choice, a player could decide to close, and all other players have one more opportunity to exchange. Certain high-scoring card combinations must be revealed, and when they are the game will end. Players are awarded points based on the highest sum of one suit, and the player with the most points wins.
