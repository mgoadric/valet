### Summary

In Pitch, a partnership trick-taking game, players are dealt 6 cards from a shuffled French deck. Players bid on the number of points they think their team can win. The player who bids the highest plays first and sets trump with their first card played. 6 tricks are played, with the winner of each trick leading the next trick. Points are awarded for the high, low, and jack of trump, along with a "game" point for the highest sum of cards collected. The team with the highest score wins.
