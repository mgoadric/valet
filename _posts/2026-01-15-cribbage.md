### Summary

Cribbage is for two players. We describe one round of Cribbage in this summary. Shuffle the deck, and deal each player six cards. Each player chooses two cards from their hand to add to a face-down crib. 
A start card is turned up from the deck, and the dealer scores two points if it is a Jack. In a round, players play one card at a time, alternating when possible as long as the sum of ranks on cards played does not exceed 31. Various points are scored based on patterns in the sequence of cards played. The total is reset to zero, rounds are repeated until all cards are played. Finally, played cards are returned to their owners, and more points are scored for sets, runs, and sums in their hand plus the face-up start card. The dealer also scores for the four cards in the crip plus the face-up start card. the player with the most points wins.

### Rules of Play

These rules are summarized from [{{ page.source }}]({{ page.source }}).

### Variants Used

We include two rounds of Cribbage, since the ownership of the crib alternates each round. This allows for fair comparisons of player algorithms.
