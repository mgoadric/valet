### Summary

Euchre is a trick-taking game for four players in partnerships. A shortened deck of 24 cards is shuffled and 5 cards are dealt to each player. The top card of the remaining deck is turned face-up.
Players in turn decide if the suit displayed will be the trump suit. If no player is willing make it trump, any suit can then be declared trump. Players can also decide to play alone (their partner would sit out) in the hopes of earning more points. The other Jack of the same color as the trump suit becomes trump, and the two Jacks are the highest ranks of trump.
Players play 5 tricks, rotating the lead to the player who won the last trick. The team that wins the majority of tricks earns points.

### Rules of Play

These rules are summarized from [{{ page.source }}]({{ page.source }}).

### Variants Used

The North American variant is used, so there is no Joker card. Only the player that chooses the trump suit is allowed to "go alone" and play without a partner. When all players initially pass on using face-up card, and the first three players pass on making a trump suit, we use the "stick the dealer" variant to force the dealer to choose a trump suit.
