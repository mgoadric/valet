### Summary


### Rules of Play

These rules are summarized from [{{ page.source }}]({{ page.source }}).

### Variants Used

The North American variant is used, so there is no Joker card. Only the player that chooses the 
trump suit is allowed to "go alone" and play without a partner. When all players initially pass on using face-up card, and the first three players pass on making a trump suit, we use the "stick the dealer" variant to force the dealer to choose a trump suit.
